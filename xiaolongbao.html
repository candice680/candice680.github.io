                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Xiaolongbao are perhaps the most famous culinary creation from Shanghai. These delicate steamed dumplings are distinctive for the flavorful soup contained within their thin wrappers, alongside a savory meat filling. When properly made, each dumpling is a perfect bite-sized package of flavor that releases a burst of aromatic broth when bitten into, followed by the tender filling. The name "xiaolongbao" refers to the small bamboo steaming baskets (xiaolong) in which they are traditionally cooked.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>While xiaolongbao are now firmly associated with Shanghai, they actually originated in Nanxiang, a suburb of Shanghai, in the 1870s. According to local lore, a baker named Huang Minxian sought to create a unique offering for his restaurant. He innovated by adding aspic (solidified meat stock) to dumpling filling, which would melt into soup during the steaming process.</p>
                    <p>The original xiaolongbao from Nanxiang were significantly larger than today's versions and contained only pork. As the dish gained popularity in Shanghai proper, they evolved to become smaller and more delicate, with a thinner skin and more refined pleating technique. By the early 20th century, xiaolongbao had become a staple of Shanghai's culinary scene, sold in teahouses and restaurants throughout the city.</p>
                    <p>Today, Nanxiang Mantou Dian (Nanxiang Steamed Bun Restaurant) at Yu Garden in Shanghai remains one of the most famous destinations for xiaolongbao, with lines often stretching around the block. The dish has also gained international fame, becoming one of the most recognizable Chinese culinary exports.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the aspic:</strong> Simmer pork skin and bones with ginger and scallions for several hours. Strain and chill until solidified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Mix flour with warm water to form a smooth, medium-firm dough. The dough should be considerably firmer than that used for regular dumplings. Rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare the filling:</strong> Combine ground pork with finely diced aspic, along with seasonings such as ginger, scallions, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and white pepper. Keep chilled until ready to use so the aspic doesn't melt.</li>
                        <li><strong>Roll the wrappers:</strong> Divide the dough into small portions and roll each into a thin round wrapper, about 3 inches in diameter. The center should be slightly thicker than the edges to support the filling.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assemble the dumplings:</strong> Place a small amount of filling in the center of each wrapper. Carefully pleat the edges, creating 14-18 folds for each dumpling, ensuring they are completely sealed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Steam the dumplings:</strong> Line a bamboo steamer with parchment paper or cabbage leaves. Arrange the dumplings with space between them, as they will expand during cooking. Steam over high heat for about 8 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serve immediately:</strong> Xiaolongbao must be served hot, as the soup inside will solidify as it cools. They are traditionally accompanied by black vinegar with thin slices of ginger for dipping.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>The perfect xiaolongbao creates a multi-sensory experience. The skin should be thin yet sturdy enough to hold the soup without breaking. When lifted with chopsticks, the dumpling should sag slightly with the weight of the soup inside but maintain its integrity.</p>
                    <p>The proper eating technique is crucial to fully appreciate xiaolongbao. One should carefully pick up the dumpling, dip it in vinegar, place it on a spoon, take a small bite from the side to release the soup, sip the soup, then eat the rest of the dumpling. This method allows one to enjoy each component—the tender wrapper, the flavorful soup, and the savory filling—both separately and together.</p>
                    <p>The soup inside should be clear and richly flavored with a clean, meaty taste. The filling should be tender and juicy, with the brightness of ginger and scallion complementing the pork. The vinegar dipping sauce adds a sharp acidity that cuts through the richness of the soup and meat.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>For a shortcut to making aspic, use powdered gelatin mixed with high-quality chicken or pork stock.</p>
                        <p>When pleating the dumplings, ensure each fold is firmly sealed to prevent soup leakage during steaming.</p>
                        <p>The thickness of the wrapper is crucial—roll from the edge toward the center, leaving the center slightly thicker to support the weight of the filling.</p>
                        <p>Never steam xiaolongbao for too long, as overcooking will cause the skins to break and the soup to escape.</p>
