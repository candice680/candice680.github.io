                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>White Cut Chicken, or "Bai Zhan Ji," is one of the most elegant and representative cold dishes in Shanghai cuisine. This seemingly simple dish highlights the natural flavor of the chicken through a meticulous poaching technique that results in exceptionally tender, juicy meat while preserving its pure taste. It's typically served chilled as an appetizer, allowing diners to appreciate the delicate texture and subtle flavors of the chicken.</p>
                    <p>Despite its simplicity, White Cut Chicken represents the sophistication of Shanghai cuisine â€“ where skilled technique and precision transform basic ingredients into something extraordinary. The dish is often considered a benchmark for measuring a chef's skill, as it requires perfect timing and temperature control to achieve the ideal texture without relying on bold seasonings to mask imperfections.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>White Cut Chicken has a rich historical legacy dating back to ancient times. The dish's origins can be traced to the Jiangnan region (south of the Yangtze River) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. At that time, the fertile land of the Yangtze River Delta allowed for the cultivation of high-quality poultry, making chicken an important protein source in the local diet.</p>
                    <p>In Shanghai, with its convergence of various regional cultures, this cooking method was refined over generations. As the city developed into a commercial hub in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, White Cut Chicken became a staple in local teahouses and restaurants, appreciated by both locals and visitors for its delicate flavors.</p>
                    <p>The dish has been passed down through family traditions and has maintained its place in Shanghai's culinary repertoire. It exemplifies the city's culinary philosophy, which values freshness of ingredients, precise cooking methods, and a balance that allows the natural flavors of food to shine.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Select the chicken:</strong> Choose a fresh, high-quality free-range chicken weighing about 1500g (3.3 lbs). Free-range chickens offer better texture and flavor for this dish.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the chicken:</strong> Clean the chicken thoroughly under cold running water. Remove any remaining feathers and internal organs. Trim excess fat from the cavity and neck area.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the aromatics:</strong> Gather 2 green onions, 1 piece of ginger (sliced into 3-4 pieces), and 3 star anise. These aromatics will infuse the chicken with subtle flavors during poaching.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the poaching liquid:</strong> Fill a large pot with enough cold water to completely submerge the chicken. Add 200ml rice wine, 15g salt, and 50g cooking oil to the water.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Initial heating:</strong> Place the whole chicken into the cold water breast-side up. Add the green onions, ginger slices, and star anise to the pot. Place over high heat and bring to a full boil.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>First poaching stage:</strong> Once boiling, let the chicken cook for 30 seconds. Using tongs, carefully lift and fully submerge the chicken several times to ensure even cooking of the skin.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Turn and continue cooking:</strong> Flip the chicken over in the pot. Maintain the boil and cook for another 30 seconds. Turn off the heat, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the chicken steep in the hot broth.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Resting period:</strong> Allow the chicken to remain in the covered pot for 15-20 minutes (adjust time based on the size of the chicken). This gentle poaching method ensures the chicken cooks through while remaining incredibly tender.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Ice bath cooling:</strong> After the steeping period, immediately transfer the chicken to an ice water bath. Let it rest in the cold water for 30-40 minutes. This stops the cooking process and firms up the skin while keeping the meat juicy.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Finishing touches:</strong> When cooled, remove the chicken from the water bath. The skin should have a smooth, gelatinous texture with a slightly yellow tinge, and the meat should be tender and moist.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the dipping sauce:</strong> Mix 5 tablespoons of green onions, 1 tablespoon of ginger, and a sprinkle of salt together. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil until hot, then pour over the mixture to release the aromas. Add 100ml of the chicken poaching liquid and mix well to create a fragrant dipping sauce.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>White Cut Chicken offers a pure, clean taste that showcases the natural flavors of the chicken. The meat should be exceptionally tender and moist, with a smooth, gelatinous skin that provides a pleasant textural contrast. The subtle infusion of ginger, green onion, and star anise adds aromatic depth without overwhelming the delicate flavor of the chicken.</p>
                    <p>The accompanying dipping sauce provides a savory counterpoint that enhances rather than masks the chicken's natural taste. The sauce, with its aromatic notes of ginger and scallion, adds complexity and a touch of saltiness that complements the mild sweetness of the meat.</p>
                    <p>When served chilled, the dish offers a refreshing quality that makes it particularly appealing as a starter or as part of a larger meal. The texture should be silky and tender, with the meat easily separating from the bone. A truly well-prepared White Cut Chicken demonstrates why this apparently simple dish has endured as one of Shanghai's most beloved culinary classics.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>The quality of the chicken is paramount for this dish. Choose a fresh, preferably free-range chicken for the best flavor and texture.</p>
                        <p>Start with cold water and a cold chicken to ensure even cooking from the inside out.</p>
                        <p>The ice bath is a crucial step â€“ it helps set the skin with a gelatinous texture while preventing the chicken from overcooking from residual heat.</p>
                        <p>For the most authentic flavor, make sure the chicken is completely cooled before slicing and serving.</p>
                        <p>When slicing the chicken, use a sharp cleaver to cut through the bones for traditional presentation, or debone for easier eating.</p>
