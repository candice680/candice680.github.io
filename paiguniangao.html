                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Pork Ribs with Rice Cake (Pai Gu Nian Gao) is a beloved Shanghai dish that perfectly showcases the city's culinary tradition of combining savory meats with chewy rice cakes. The dish features tender pork ribs simmered in a rich, savory sauce alongside soft, chewy rice cakes that absorb the flavorful broth. This combination creates a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors that has made it a favorite among locals and visitors alike.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Rice cakes (Nian Gao) have been a staple in Chinese cuisine for centuries, particularly in the Jiangnan region where Shanghai is located. The combination of pork ribs with rice cakes likely emerged during the late Qing Dynasty, as Shanghai's culinary culture was developing its distinctive style. The dish became particularly popular in the early 20th century, when it was commonly served in Shanghai's traditional restaurants and street food stalls.</p>
                    <p>In Shanghai's culinary tradition, rice cakes are often used as a starch component in savory dishes, similar to how noodles or rice might be used in other regions. The chewy texture of the rice cakes provides a satisfying contrast to the tender meat, while also helping to thicken and enrich the sauce. This dish is particularly popular during the winter months, as the warm, hearty nature of the dish provides comfort during cold weather.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients:</strong> Cut the pork ribs into 2-inch pieces, and soak the rice cakes in warm water for 30 minutes to soften them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blanch the ribs:</strong> In a pot of boiling water, blanch the pork ribs for 2-3 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> In a bowl, combine soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar, and water. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cook the ribs:</strong> In a wok or large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add ginger, garlic, and scallions, and stir-fry until fragrant. Add the blanched ribs and stir-fry until lightly browned.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simmer the ribs:</strong> Pour the sauce mixture over the ribs. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes until the ribs are tender.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add rice cakes:</strong> Add the soaked rice cakes to the pot and continue simmering for 10-15 minutes until they are soft and have absorbed the sauce.</li>
                        <li><strong>Thicken the sauce:</strong> If needed, add a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce to your desired consistency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Finish and serve:</strong> Garnish with chopped scallions and serve hot. The dish should have a rich, glossy sauce that coats both the ribs and rice cakes.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>Pai Gu Nian Gao offers a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The pork ribs should be tender and fall-off-the-bone, while the rice cakes should be soft and chewy, having absorbed the rich sauce. The sauce itself should be savory and slightly sweet, with a depth of flavor from the soy sauces and Shaoxing wine.</p>
                    <p>The dish is particularly satisfying because of the contrast between the tender meat and the chewy rice cakes. Each bite should offer a combination of these textures, along with the rich, savory sauce that ties everything together. The rice cakes act not just as a starch component, but also as a sponge that absorbs and enhances the flavor of the sauce.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>Fresh rice cakes are preferred, but if unavailable, you can use frozen ones. Just make sure to thaw them completely before soaking.</p>
                        <p>The key to tender ribs is the initial blanching step, which removes impurities and helps the meat become more tender during cooking.</p>
                        <p>Adjust the sauce consistency to your preference - some like it thicker, while others prefer it more soupy.</p>
                        <p>If the rice cakes become too soft, you can add them later in the cooking process. If they're too hard, you can soak them longer or simmer them longer.</p>
