                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Stir-Fried Eel, known locally as "Shan Si," is one of Shanghai's most acclaimed classic dishes. This culinary masterpiece is deeply rooted in the Yangtze River region's food culture and is especially treasured for its distinctive flavor profile and unique preparation techniques. The dish showcases the natural richness of fresh eel, enhanced by a carefully balanced sweet-savory sauce that has made it a favorite among locals and visitors alike.</p>
                    <p>The name "Shan Si" itself carries a poetic quality that reflects the dish's status in Shanghai cuisine. The carefully prepared eel, with its caramelized exterior and tender, succulent flesh, represents the perfect harmony between the freshwater ingredients of the Yangtze Delta and the refined cooking techniques developed over generations in Shanghai's kitchens.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Stir-Fried Eel has a distinguished history that spans many centuries. The dish can be traced back to ancient times when the residents of the Jiangnan region (south of the Yangtze River) first began to appreciate the unique qualities of freshwater eel. The abundant waterways in this area provided a rich source of various fish species, but eel was particularly valued for its nutritional properties and distinctive taste.</p>
                    <p>As Shanghai developed into a major commercial center during the late Qing Dynasty, the city's culinary traditions evolved to incorporate more refined techniques. The preparation of eel, once a simple countryside dish, became more sophisticated. Local chefs developed methods to remove the muddy taste that sometimes accompanied freshwater fish and created complex sauces that complemented the natural flavor of the eel.</p>
                    <p>With the growth of Shanghai's restaurant culture in the early 20th century, "Shan Si" became a signature dish that exemplified the city's approach to cooking – techniques that honor traditional ingredients while incorporating innovative methods. Today, it remains a vital part of Shanghai's culinary heritage, connecting modern diners to centuries of gastronomic tradition.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Select the ingredients:</strong> Choose a fresh river eel weighing approximately 500g. The freshness of the eel is crucial to the final dish's quality. Prepare 3-4 green onions, 1 piece of ginger, 1 garlic clove, and 2-3 star anise pods. Gather cooking oil, salt, sugar, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the eel:</strong> With a sharp knife, cut the eel's head below the gills. Make a shallow cut along the spine and carefully peel away the skin. Remove the internal organs and thoroughly wash the eel under cold running water. Cut the eel into 5-6 cm sections.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Pre-cook the eel:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the eel sections. Blanch briefly until they begin to curl, then remove and rinse in cold water. This step helps remove any remaining blood and impurities, ensuring a clean flavor.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Create the flavor base:</strong> Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add green onions, ginger, and garlic, stir-frying until fragrant. Add star anise and continue to cook for another minute to release its aroma.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Initial stir-fry:</strong> Add the blanched eel sections to the wok. Stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes until the eel begins to absorb the aromatics' flavors.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Add seasonings:</strong> Pour in 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Stir thoroughly to coat the eel evenly with the sauce mixture.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Braising stage:</strong> Add just enough water to partially cover the eel. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes until the eel is tender but still maintains its texture.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Reduce the sauce:</strong> Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Allow the sauce to reduce, occasionally turning the eel pieces to ensure they're evenly glazed. This should take about 5-7 minutes until the sauce thickens to a glossy consistency.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Final seasoning:</strong> During the final minutes of cooking, add white pepper, a drop of sesame oil, and adjust salt to taste. The sauce should have reduced to a rich glaze that coats the eel pieces.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Transfer to a serving plate, arranging the eel sections neatly. Pour any remaining sauce over the eel. Garnish with finely sliced green onion tops and serve hot.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>Stir-Fried Eel offers a complex and layered flavor experience that showcases why this dish has remained so popular throughout Shanghai's culinary history. The eel itself should be perfectly tender, with the flesh easily separating from the central bone while still maintaining a pleasing firmness.</p>
                    <p>The sauce presents a masterful balance of sweet and savory notes – the natural sweetness of the eel is enhanced by the caramelized sugar, while the soy sauce provides depth and umami. The subtle fragrance of star anise, ginger, and green onion infuses the dish without overwhelming the delicate flavor of the eel.</p>
                    <p>Texturally, the dish offers a wonderful contrast between the crisp exterior of the eel sections and their moist, rich interior. The sauce, reduced to a glossy consistency, clings to each piece, creating a sumptuous mouthfeel that embodies the refinement of Shanghai cuisine. When properly prepared, Stir-Fried Eel demonstrates the perfect balance between simplicity and sophistication that characterizes the best of traditional Shanghai cooking.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>The freshness of the eel is paramount – look for live eels with clear eyes and responsive movements for the best flavor.</p>
                        <p>Do not skip the blanching step, as it's crucial for removing any muddy taste and blood from the eel.</p>
                        <p>Control the heat carefully during the final sauce reduction phase. Too high heat can burn the sauce, while too low heat won't achieve the desired glossy glaze.</p>
                        <p>The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the eel sections. Test for doneness by checking if the flesh easily separates from the bone.</p>
                        <p>For the most authentic flavor, use a carbon steel wok that has been properly seasoned, as it imparts a subtle "wok hei" (breath of the wok) to the dish.</p>
