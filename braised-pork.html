                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Braised Pork Belly (Hong Shao Rou) is one of the most iconic dishes in Shanghai cuisine. This sumptuous dish features succulent cubes of pork belly that are first caramelized in sugar, then braised in a rich sauce of soy, rice wine, and spices until they become meltingly tender with a glossy, mahogany-colored exterior. The perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors is what makes this dish distinctively Shanghainese.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Hong Shao Rou has a long history in Chinese cuisine, with versions of the dish appearing in records dating back to the Qing Dynasty. However, the Shanghai style—characterized by its distinctive red-brown color and sweet-savory flavor profile—evolved during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the city flourished as a trading port.</p>
                    <p>The dish gained particular fame when it was reportedly served at state banquets and became a favorite of Chairman Mao Zedong. This association elevated its status and popularity throughout China. In Shanghai homes, the dish traditionally appears during festivals and special occasions, though it is now enjoyed year-round as a comfort food staple.</p>
                    <p>Each family in Shanghai typically has their own variation of the recipe, with subtle differences in sweetness, spicing, and braising time passed down through generations. These family recipes are often closely guarded secrets, with the exact balance of ingredients considered a matter of pride.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the pork:</strong> Cut pork belly into 1.5-inch cubes. Blanch in boiling water for 3-5 minutes to remove impurities, then drain and pat dry.</li>
                        <li><strong>Caramelize the sugar:</strong> In a heavy-bottomed pot, melt rock sugar or white sugar over medium heat until it turns amber in color.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sear the pork:</strong> Add the pork belly cubes to the caramelized sugar and stir to coat each piece. Cook until the exterior of the pork begins to brown and caramelize.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add aromatics:</strong> Introduce ginger, scallions, star anise, cinnamon, and dried chilies (if using) to the pot. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add liquids:</strong> Pour in Shaoxing wine, light and dark soy sauce, and enough water to just cover the pork. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slow braise:</strong> Cover the pot partially and simmer for 1.5-2 hours, or until the pork is tender enough to break apart with chopsticks. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce the sauce:</strong> Remove the lid and increase heat to medium-high. Allow the sauce to reduce and thicken, continuously spooning it over the pork until each piece is glossy and well-glazed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong> Let the dish rest for 10 minutes before serving, allowing the flavors to further penetrate the meat. Serve with steamed rice and fresh greens.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>A perfectly executed Hong Shao Rou offers a harmonious blend of textures and flavors. The exterior of each pork cube should be glossy and caramelized, while the interior remains succulent and tender. The fat should be meltingly soft, almost dissolving on the tongue, but not greasy.</p>
                    <p>The flavor profile is complex—predominantly savory from the soy sauce, with noticeable sweetness from the caramelized sugar. This is balanced by the subtle warmth of spices and the depth contributed by the Shaoxing wine. There should be a lingering umami finish that makes each bite satisfying.</p>
                    <p>Shanghai-style Hong Shao Rou is typically sweeter than versions from other regions of China, which is a characteristic feature of the city's cuisine. The sauce should be rich and reduced to a syrupy consistency that clings to the meat.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>Select pork belly with a good ratio of fat to lean meat—ideally about 50/50. Too lean and the dish will be dry; too fatty and it may become too rich.</p>
                        <p>The caramelization of sugar is crucial for developing the dish's characteristic color and flavor. Watch it carefully to prevent burning.</p>
                        <p>Traditional Shanghai-style Hong Shao Rou is quite sweet. Adjust the sugar according to your preference while maintaining the dish's authentic character.</p>
                        <p>For the best texture, braise slowly over low heat. The meat should be tender enough to cut with chopsticks but still hold its shape.</p>
