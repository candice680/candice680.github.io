                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Pan-Fried Buns (Sheng Jian Bao) are a beloved Shanghai street food that offers an irresistible textural contrast: a crispy, golden bottom, fluffy steamed top, and juicy pork filling. While they may appear similar to their more famous cousin, xiaolongbao, sheng jian bao are distinguished by their cooking method, which combines pan-frying and steaming to create a unique duality of textures. They are particularly popular as a breakfast item but can be enjoyed at any time of day.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Sheng Jian Bao emerged in Shanghai in the early 20th century, during a period of rapid urbanization and culinary innovation. Food vendors sought ways to create delicious, filling foods that could be prepared quickly and eaten on the go by the city's growing workforce. The ingenious cooking method—pan-frying followed by steaming—was developed to efficiently cook these buns and give them their signature crispy base.</p>
                    <p>Originally, these buns were made with simple yeast dough and filled with seasoned pork. Over time, variations emerged, with some shops adding gelatin to the filling (which melts during cooking to create soup inside) or incorporating different seasonings. Still, the classic sheng jian bao remains a constant in Shanghai's culinary landscape, with numerous family-run shops claiming to have the most authentic version.</p>
                    <p>Today, these pan-fried buns are considered one of the "Four Heavenly Kings" of Shanghai street food, alongside xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), congyoubing (scallion pancakes), and cifantuan (glutinous rice rolls).</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> Combine flour, yeast, sugar, and warm water to form a soft, elastic dough. Knead until smooth, then allow to rise for about an hour until doubled in size.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Mix ground pork with scallions, ginger, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, and sugar. For a soupy filling, add diced aspic (solidified stock) that will melt during cooking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Divide and fill:</strong> Punch down the risen dough and divide into equal pieces. Roll each piece into a round wrapper, place filling in the center, then pleat and pinch to seal, forming a bun.</li>
                        <li><strong>Arrange for cooking:</strong> Place the buns in a heavy, oiled skillet, spacing them slightly apart as they will expand during cooking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pan-fry:</strong> Cook the buns over medium heat until the bottoms begin to turn golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add water and steam:</strong> Pour a small amount of water into the pan (enough to reach about 1/4 inch up the sides of the buns), then immediately cover with a lid.</li>
                        <li><strong>Finish cooking:</strong> Allow the buns to steam for 7-8 minutes or until the water has evaporated and the dough is fully cooked.</li>
                        <li><strong>Garnish and serve:</strong> Sprinkle with sesame seeds and chopped scallions. Serve hot, accompanied by black vinegar for dipping.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>A perfect Sheng Jian Bao presents a study in contrasts. The bottom crust should be golden-brown and crispy, almost shattering when bitten into, while the top remains soft, white, and pillowy. The filling should be juicy and flavorful, with the fat from the pork creating a moist, succulent interior.</p>
                    <p>The flavor profile balances the savory richness of the pork with the bright notes of ginger and scallion. The subtle sweetness of the dough complements the umami-rich filling, while a dip in tangy black vinegar cuts through the richness and adds complexity.</p>
                    <p>Be cautious when taking your first bite—if the bun contains soup, it can squirt out when bitten, much like xiaolongbao. The proper technique is to take a small bite, allow the steam to escape, then enjoy the rest.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>Use a heavy-bottomed pan with a tight-fitting lid for the best results – cast iron is ideal as it distributes heat evenly for a uniformly crisp bottom.</p>
                        <p>The dough should be slightly stickier than regular bread dough but still manageable. If it's too dry, the buns will be tough.</p>
                        <p>When adding water for steaming, pour it down the side of the pan rather than directly on the buns to preserve their crispy bottoms.</p>
                        <p>Don't be tempted to check on the buns too frequently during steaming, as this releases the steam needed for proper cooking.</p>
