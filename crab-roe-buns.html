                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Crab Roe Buns (Xie Huang Bao) are one of Shanghai's most celebrated dim sum dishes, beloved for their exquisite flavor and delicate presentation. These dumplings feature a savory filling primarily made from crab roe and meat, wrapped in a thin, carefully pleated dough. When steamed to perfection, they offer a burst of rich, umami flavor that epitomizes Shanghai's refined culinary tradition.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Xie Huang Bao emerged in the early 20th century when Shanghai was developing into a cosmopolitan hub. The dish represents the pinnacle of Shanghai's luxury cuisine, highlighting the local love for hairy crab—a seasonal delicacy from nearby Yangcheng Lake that appears in autumn. Traditionally, these buns were available only during crab season (September to November) and were considered a special treat that showcased both culinary skill and the finest seasonal ingredients.</p>
                    <p>In the past, only the wealthy could afford dishes made with pure crab roe. To make the delicacy more accessible, chefs began combining crab roe with pork, creating the version that remains popular today. Over the decades, the dish has become a symbol of Shanghai's culinary prowess, served in establishments ranging from humble teahouses to high-end restaurants.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> Mix flour and water to create a smooth, elastic dough. Allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes to develop gluten.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Combine fresh crab roe and meat with minced pork. Season with Shaoxing wine, ginger, scallions, salt, white pepper, and a touch of sugar.</li>
                        <li><strong>Roll the dough:</strong> Divide the dough into small portions and roll each into a thin round wrapper, about 3-4 inches in diameter. The center should be slightly thicker than the edges.</li>
                        <li><strong>Form the buns:</strong> Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each wrapper. Carefully pleat the edges to form a pouch, ensuring the filling is completely enclosed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Steam the buns:</strong> Arrange the buns in a bamboo steamer lined with cabbage leaves or parchment paper. Steam over high heat for about 8 minutes until the dough is cooked through and translucent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serve immediately:</strong> The buns should be served hot, accompanied by black vinegar and ginger strips for dipping.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>A properly prepared Crab Roe Bun offers multiple layers of flavor and texture. The wrapper should be delicate yet sturdy enough to hold the filling. The filling itself delivers the rich, distinctive taste of crab roe—slightly sweet, deeply savory, with the natural sweetness of fresh crab meat. The addition of pork provides a subtle richness that balances the briny notes of the crab.</p>
                    <p>The first bite typically releases a small amount of flavorful juice, so traditional etiquette suggests either consuming the bun whole or carefully taking a small bite and sipping the juice before eating the rest. Black vinegar cuts through the richness, while fresh ginger adds a bright, aromatic contrast.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>For the most authentic flavor, source fresh hairy crab during autumn when they're in season. Out of season, quality frozen crab roe can be used instead.</p>
                        <p>The dough should be slightly firmer than that used for regular steamed buns to properly contain the filling.</p>
                        <p>When pleating the buns, aim for at least 18 pleats for the most traditional appearance.</p>
