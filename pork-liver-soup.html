                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Pork Liver Soup (Zhu Gan Tang) is a traditional Shanghai dish that exemplifies the city's approach to nutritious yet flavorful cooking. This light, clear soup features thin slices of tender pork liver and sometimes other offal, gently poached in a delicate broth perfumed with ginger, rice wine, and scallions. Unlike the more intense flavors found in some Shanghai dishes, this soup offers a subtle complexity that highlights the natural flavor of the liver while eliminating any unpleasant minerality. It's considered both a culinary delight and a health tonic, particularly valued for its iron content and blood-nourishing properties in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Pork Liver Soup has its roots in Shanghai's traditional home cooking, dating back to at least the late Qing Dynasty (late 19th century). In a city once crisscrossed with canals and situated at the mouth of the Yangtze River, fresh ingredients were abundant, but so was the need for nourishing food that could sustain the working population.</p>
                    <p>The soup emerged from the waste-not philosophy of Chinese cuisine, which values all parts of an animal. Liver, being particularly nutritious but sometimes challenging to prepare in a palatable way, was transformed through careful preparation and gentle cooking into a delicacy. Traditional Chinese medicine has long valued liver as a food that nourishes the blood and improves vision, making this soup especially popular among women after childbirth and those recovering from illness.</p>
                    <p>Over time, the soup evolved from a purely medicinal preparation to a beloved dish served in homes and humble eateries throughout Shanghai. Each family typically has its own variation, with slight differences in seasoning and accompanying ingredients, but the core technique of quickly cooking the liver to maintain its tenderness remains consistent.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the liver:</strong> Clean fresh pork liver thoroughly under cold running water. Remove any membranes or visible blood vessels. Slice the liver thinly (about 1/8 inch thick) against the grain. Soak in cold water for 30 minutes, changing the water once or twice to remove any blood.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make the marinade:</strong> In a bowl, combine sliced liver with Shaoxing wine, a small amount of cornstarch, white pepper, and a pinch of salt. Mix gently and let marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare the broth:</strong> In a pot, combine chicken or pork stock with ginger slices and white parts of scallions. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for about 15 minutes to infuse the flavors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blanch the vegetables:</strong> Briefly blanch any accompanying vegetables (such as spinach or bok choy) in boiling water, then arrange them in serving bowls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cook the liver:</strong> Remove the ginger and scallion from the broth. Bring the broth back to a gentle simmer (not a rolling boil). Add the marinated liver slices, stirring gently to separate them. Cook just until the liver changes color and is no longer pink inside, about 30-45 seconds. Overcooking will toughen the liver.</li>
                        <li><strong>Season and serve:</strong> Remove from heat immediately. Season the soup with a small amount of salt, a drop of sesame oil, and white pepper to taste. Ladle the hot soup with liver slices over the prepared vegetables in bowls. Garnish with chopped scallion greens and cilantro if desired.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>A properly prepared Pork Liver Soup presents a study in restraint and balance. The broth should be clear and light, with a subtle aroma of ginger and scallion that sets the stage for the liver. The liver itself should be incredibly tender—almost velvety in texture—with a clean, mild flavor that bears no trace of bitterness or strong minerality.</p>
                    <p>The soup offers layers of flavor that unfold gradually: the initial warmth of the broth gives way to the delicate sweetness of the liver, enhanced by the aromatic notes of ginger and the gentle tang of Shaoxing wine. The sesame oil provides a final note of nutty depth without overwhelming the dish.</p>
                    <p>Texturally, the contrast between the silky liver and the crisp vegetables (if included) creates a pleasing counterpoint. The overall experience is one of refinement and subtlety—qualities highly prized in Shanghai cuisine—while still delivering the nourishing essence that makes this soup a perennial favorite, especially during cooler months or when one is feeling under the weather.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>The freshness of the liver is paramount – seek out a butcher who can provide same-day fresh pork liver for the best flavor and texture.</p>
                        <p>Soaking the liver in cold water helps remove any blood, which can contribute to a bitter taste. Change the water several times during soaking for best results.</p>
                        <p>The cooking time for liver is extremely brief – overcooking even by a minute will result in tough, grainy liver instead of the desired silky texture.</p>
                        <p>For a more substantial meal, this soup can be served over cooked rice or noodles, though traditionally it's enjoyed as a light soup course on its own.</p>
