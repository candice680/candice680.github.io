                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Crab Roe Noodles, or "Xie Huang Mian," is one of Shanghai's most celebrated gourmet dishes, representing the pinnacle of local culinary refinement. This exquisite dish features delicate handmade noodles topped with a luscious sauce made from the prized golden roe of freshwater hairy crabs, creating a harmonious blend of subtle flavors and luxurious textures.</p>
                    <p>Traditionally enjoyed during autumn when hairy crabs are in season, this dish exemplifies the Shanghai culinary philosophy that values seasonal ingredients at their peak freshness. The delicate sweetness of crab roe combined with the silky texture of the noodles creates an elegant dining experience that has captivated food enthusiasts for generations.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Crab Roe Noodles have a distinguished history that dates back to the late Qing Dynasty. Shanghai's unique geographical location at the mouth of the Yangtze River provided abundant access to premium seafood, particularly the prized hairy crabs from nearby Yangcheng Lake. These crabs, especially valued for their rich golden roe, became a symbol of luxury and refined taste in Shanghai's culinary culture.</p>
                    <p>As Shanghai developed into an international commercial hub in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city's cuisine evolved to reflect both traditional Chinese flavors and Western influences. During this period, master chefs in Shanghai's prestigious restaurants perfected the technique of extracting and preparing crab roe to create this sophisticated dish.</p>
                    <p>Crab Roe Noodles soon became a favorite among Shanghai's elite society and foreign visitors, who appreciated the dish's subtle complexity and seasonal significance. Today, it remains an emblem of Shanghai's culinary heritage, representing both the city's connection to local ingredients and its reputation for culinary innovation and refinement.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Select the ingredients:</strong> Choose 5-6 fresh hairy crabs (approximately 500g total) during autumn season for the best roe. For the noodles, prepare 200g of thin wheat noodles, preferably freshly made. Gather 2-3 green onions, 1 piece of ginger, 1 garlic clove, 2 star anise, and seasonings including rice wine, soy sauce, and cooking oil.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the crabs:</strong> Thoroughly clean the live crabs under running water. Remove the abdomen cover and carefully extract the bright orange roe (female crabs) and the creamy yellowish milt (male crabs). Set the roe and milt aside separately.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Create the flavor base:</strong> Heat oil in a wok, add green onions, ginger, garlic, and star anise. Stir-fry until fragrant to create an aromatic foundation for the sauce.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Cook the crab roe:</strong> Add the crab roe to the wok and stir gently over medium-low heat for about 15-20 minutes until thoroughly cooked. Be careful not to overcook or stir too vigorously, as this can break apart the delicate roe.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Season the sauce:</strong> Add a splash of Shaoxing wine and a small amount of light soy sauce to enhance the flavor. Add a little chicken stock to create a sauce-like consistency. Season with salt to taste, being careful not to overpower the natural sweetness of the crab roe.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the noodles:</strong> Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to package instructions until just al dente. Drain well and rinse briefly with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Combine components:</strong> Place the cooked noodles in serving bowls. Gently ladle the crab roe sauce over the noodles. If using both male and female crab parts, you can place them in separate sections of the dish for visual appeal.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Garnish and serve:</strong> Finish with a drizzle of high-quality oil and finely chopped green onion tops. Serve immediately while hot to appreciate the full flavor and aroma of the dish.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>Crab Roe Noodles offer a sophisticated flavor profile that highlights the natural sweetness and rich umami of the crab roe. The delicate golden roe should have a creamy texture that melts in the mouth, releasing a subtle oceanic sweetness that speaks to its freshwater origins.</p>
                    <p>The noodles serve as the perfect canvas, absorbing the sauce while maintaining their silky texture and providing a subtle wheaten backdrop that doesn't compete with the star ingredient. The aromatic notes of ginger and green onion provide just enough complexity to enhance the crab flavor without overwhelming it.</p>
                    <p>When properly prepared, this dish offers a harmonious balance of textures—from the silky noodles to the creamy, granular roe—and flavors that range from sweet to savory with the most subtle hint of brininess. The overall experience is one of refined luxury, demonstrating why this seasonal delicacy holds such an esteemed place in Shanghai's culinary pantheon.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>The quality of crabs is paramount – choose live hairy crabs in autumn (September to November) when their roe is at its richest.</p>
                        <p>Handle the crab roe with extreme care as it's very delicate. Use gentle, slow stirring motions to prevent breaking it apart.</p>
                        <p>Cooking the roe over gentle heat is crucial – too high a temperature will cause it to lose its creamy texture and distinctive flavor.</p>
                        <p>Balance the seasonings carefully – the goal is to enhance the natural sweetness of the crab roe, not mask it.</p>
                        <p>This dish should be served immediately after preparation to enjoy the optimal texture and temperature contrast between the warm sauce and the noodles.</p>
