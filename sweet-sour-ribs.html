                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Sweet and Sour Ribs (Tang Cu Xiao Pai) is one of Shanghai's most beloved dishes, featuring tender pork ribs coated in a glossy, caramelized sauce that perfectly balances sweet and sour flavors. Unlike the thick, heavy sweet and sour sauces found in Westernized Chinese dishes, the authentic Shanghai version offers a more refined, delicate balance where the tangy-sweet glaze enhances rather than overwhelms the natural flavor of the pork. The ribs are typically cut into single-bone sections, allowing the sauce to coat each piece generously while making them easy to pick up and enjoy with chopsticks.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>The sweet and sour flavor profile has deep roots in traditional Chinese cuisine, particularly in the eastern coastal regions like Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Historical records indicate that sweet and sour dishes were being prepared as early as the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), though the specific combination with pork ribs likely developed later.</p>
                    <p>In Shanghai, Tang Cu Xiao Pai gained popularity during the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican era (late 19th to early 20th century), as the city transformed into a cosmopolitan hub where culinary traditions from surrounding regions merged and evolved. The dish particularly flourished in Shanghai's famous "shikumen" (stone gate) neighborhoods, where it was served both in restaurants and prepared in home kitchens for special occasions.</p>
                    <p>The precise balance of sweet and sour elements in the dish is considered a mark of a skilled chef. Traditional Shanghai cuisine tends to favor a subtle sweetness compared to other regional Chinese cuisines, a characteristic clearly reflected in this classic dish. Today, Tang Cu Xiao Pai remains a staple on menus throughout Shanghai and is often served as part of a banquet or family-style meal.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the ribs:</strong> Ask your butcher to cut pork ribs into small, single-bone pieces (about 1.5-2 inches long). Rinse them under cold water and pat dry.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blanch the ribs:</strong> In a pot of boiling water with a few slices of ginger, blanch the ribs for 2-3 minutes to remove any impurities. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Marinate the ribs:</strong> In a bowl, mix the ribs with Shaoxing wine, a small amount of soy sauce, and white pepper. Allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, combine rice vinegar, sugar, Zhenjiang black vinegar, and water or stock. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heat the oil:</strong> In a wok or deep pot, heat vegetable oil to approximately 350°F (175°C).</li>
                        <li><strong>Fry the ribs:</strong> Carefully add the marinated ribs to the hot oil and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy on the outside, about 5-6 minutes. Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare the wok:</strong> Pour out all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the wok. Add thinly sliced ginger, minced garlic, and the white parts of scallions. Stir-fry briefly until fragrant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create the glaze:</strong> Pour the sweet and sour sauce mixture into the wok. Bring to a boil and cook until the sauce begins to thicken and reduce.</li>
                        <li><strong>Return the ribs:</strong> Add the fried ribs back to the wok, tossing them continuously to coat them evenly with the sauce. Continue to cook until the sauce has further reduced and clings to the ribs in a shiny glaze.</li>
                        <li><strong>Finish and garnish:</strong> Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and the green parts of the scallions just before serving. Traditionally, the ribs are arranged in a circular pattern on a serving plate.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>Authentic Tang Cu Xiao Pai offers a multi-layered experience of flavors and textures. The exterior of each rib should be slightly crispy from the initial frying, with a glistening, caramelized glaze that catches the light. The meat itself should be tender and juicy, easily separating from the bone when bitten.</p>
                    <p>The sauce strikes a perfect balance between tanginess from the vinegar and sweetness from the sugar, with neither element overpowering the other. There's a subtle depth provided by the Shaoxing wine in the marinade, while the aromatic notes of ginger and garlic add dimension without dominating. The finish should be clean and bright, leaving a pleasant lingering sweet-sour sensation rather than a heavy, cloying sweetness.</p>
                    <p>In Shanghai, these ribs are traditionally eaten on their own as an appetizer or "cold dish" before the main meal, but they also pair wonderfully with plain steamed rice, which helps balance their intense flavor profile.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>Ask your butcher for "baby back ribs" or "St. Louis-style ribs" and request them to be cut into individual pieces for the most authentic presentation.</p>
                        <p>Zhenjiang (Chinkiang) black vinegar is essential for the authentic flavor of this dish – regular balsamic vinegar is not an appropriate substitute.</p>
                        <p>When frying the ribs, maintain the oil temperature carefully – too hot, and the ribs will burn; too cool, and they'll absorb too much oil.</p>
                        <p>The final sauce should coat the ribs in a shiny glaze rather than pooling at the bottom of the dish. If the sauce is too thin, continue reducing it; if too thick, add a small splash of water.</p>
