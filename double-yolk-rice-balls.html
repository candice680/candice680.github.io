                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Double-Yolk Rice Balls, known locally as "Shuang Huang Tuan," are a cherished traditional sweet snack in Shanghai cuisine. These delightful glutinous rice dumplings feature a sophisticated combination of textures and flavors – tender, chewy rice dough on the outside with a contrasting filling of sweet bean paste and salted egg yolks on the inside.</p>
                    <p>This delicate dessert showcases the artful balance of flavors that characterizes Shanghai's culinary traditions, combining the subtle sweetness of the bean paste with the rich, savory notes of the salted egg yolks. Traditionally enjoyed as an afternoon tea treat, Double-Yolk Rice Balls remain one of Shanghai's most beloved traditional desserts, appreciated by generations of locals and visitors alike.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                    <p>Double-Yolk Rice Balls have a rich heritage in Shanghai's culinary history. This traditional sweet treat has endured as one of the city's most beloved desserts, with a history stretching back many generations. The dish represents the intersection of Shanghai's agricultural abundance, with access to quality rice from the surrounding fertile lands and the culinary creativity of local chefs.</p>
                    <p>Traditionally served as an afternoon tea delicacy, these rice balls became an integral part of Shanghai's social culture. They were often featured in teahouses across the city, where patrons would gather to enjoy leisurely conversations over these delicate treats. The inclusion of salted egg yolks, a prized ingredient in Chinese cuisine, elevated the simple rice dumpling to a more sophisticated delicacy.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, while many aspects of Shanghai cuisine have evolved with modern influences, Double-Yolk Rice Balls have maintained their traditional preparation methods and flavors, continuing to be made by hand in many establishments. Today, they represent a tangible connection to Shanghai's culinary past and continue to be cherished by locals as an authentic taste of the city's sweet culinary traditions.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li><strong>Prepare the rice flour mixture:</strong> Combine glutinous rice flour and regular rice flour in a ratio of approximately 2:1. This combination provides the perfect balance of chewiness and tenderness in the finished dumplings.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Create the dough base:</strong> Add warm water to the flour mixture gradually, stirring continuously to form a smooth dough. Divide the dough into small portions and steam them until fully cooked, resulting in a translucent appearance.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prepare the fillings:</strong> Work with sweetened red bean paste for the bean filling component. For the egg portion, select quality salted duck egg yolks which have been cured to achieve the perfect level of saltiness.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong> After steaming, while the dough is still hot, knead it thoroughly to create a smooth, elastic texture that will be easy to work with and yield the proper consistency when eaten.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Shape and fill the dumplings:</strong> Take a portion of the kneaded dough and flatten it into a round wrapper. Place a portion of sweet bean paste and a salted egg yolk piece in the center of each wrapper.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Form the dumplings:</strong> Carefully gather the edges of the dough wrapper around the filling, pinching them together to seal completely. Roll gently between your palms to form a smooth, round ball shape.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Final steaming:</strong> Place the formed rice balls in a steamer lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Steam for approximately 5-8 minutes until the dumplings are heated through and have a slightly translucent exterior.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the rice balls to cool slightly before serving, as the filling will be very hot. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, traditionally accompanied by tea.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Tasting Notes</h2>
                    <p>Double-Yolk Rice Balls offer a compelling interplay of textures and flavors that exemplify the artful balance found in traditional Shanghai sweets. The outer rice layer should be delightfully chewy yet tender, with a slightly translucent quality that signals proper preparation. This glutinous exterior provides a subtle, clean foundation that allows the flavors of the filling to shine.</p>
                    <p>Within each dumpling, the sweet red bean paste offers a gentle sweetness with earthy undertones, creating a perfect counterpoint to the rich, savory-salty character of the egg yolk. The salted egg yolk provides a distinctive creamy texture and complex umami flavor that transforms what might otherwise be an ordinary sweet into a sophisticated delicacy.</p>
                    <p>The contrast between the mild sweetness of the bean paste and the distinctive savoriness of the egg yolk creates a multi-dimensional taste experience that has made this treat enduringly popular. Unlike many overly sweet desserts, Double-Yolk Rice Balls showcase Shanghai cuisine's preference for nuanced flavors and textural contrasts, making them a refined conclusion to a meal or a perfect accompaniment to tea in the afternoon.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
                        <p>The quality of rice flour significantly impacts the texture of the dumplings – use freshly milled flour if possible for the best results.</p>
                        <p>When working with the steamed dough, keep your hands slightly damp to prevent sticking without making the dough too wet.</p>
                        <p>For the perfect texture, avoid overworking the dough after steaming – knead just until smooth and pliable.</p>
                        <p>The salted egg yolks should be firm but not overly dry – select ones that have been cured for the appropriate amount of time.</p>
                        <p>These dumplings are best enjoyed fresh on the day they are made, as the texture of the rice balls changes when refrigerated and reheated.</p>
